### Goal
 - identify and segment functional tissue units (FTUs) across five human organs: prostate, spleen, kidney, large intestine.
 - analyze the data on the following criteria:
   - Methodology
      - Are the statistical and modeling methods used to identify FTUs appropriate for the task?
      - Are confidence scores and other metrics provided that help interpret the results achieved by the segmentation methods?
      - Is the presented characterization of FTUs useful for understanding individual differences, e.g., the impact of donor sex, age on the size, shape, or spatial distribution of FTUs?
      - Is it possible to predict FTU area size distribution, given age and sex info across all organs?
      - Did the team validate their methods and algorithm implementations and provide information on algorithm performance and limitations?
      - Did the team document their method and code appropriately?
      - Did the team develop a creative or novel method to segment FTUs?
      - Did the team provide insights that would be useful for generating reference FTUs for inclusion into a Human Reference Atlas?
   - Diversity and Presentation
     - Does the team embrace diversity and equity, welcoming team members of different ages, genders, ethnicities, and with multiple backgrounds and perspectives?
     - Did the authors effectively communicate the details of their method for segmenting FTUs, and the quality and limitations of their results? For example, did they use data visualizations to present algorithm setup, run, results and/or to provide insight into the comparative performance of different methods? Were these visualizations effective at communicating insights about their approach and results to experts and novice users?
     - Are the important results easily understood by the average person?
